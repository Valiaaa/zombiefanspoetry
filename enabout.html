        <h2>This page is intended to organize and display the "poetry" created by bot accounts on "Weibo", which is the Chinese version of Twitter.</h2>
        <h2>Since 2017, Weibo has been increasing its efforts to ban bot accounts that do not post any original content in order to combat the purchase of bot followers by users. Therefore, in order not to be detected by the system, these bot accounts began to refer to human-created texts, rearrange and integrate them through algorithms, and eventually publish them as their "original" posts. Due to the limitations of the algorithm, most of the texts they create are irrational. However, just like the "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infinite_monkey_theorem"target="_blank">Infinite Monkey Theorem</a> ", some unconscious and meaningless "literature" began to have a romantic and poetic meaning.</h2>
        <h2>How will our future change when art and literature is no longer created only by humans?</h2>
        <br><br><h2>The text excerpted in this collection has only been manually segmented. The content is not modified in any way.</h2>
        <h2>Thanks to the Weibo account<a href="https://weibo.com/u/6459849183"target="_blank">@僵尸文学bot</a> for the permission of the content.</h2></div>
